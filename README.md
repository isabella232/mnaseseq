## Introduction

**nfcore/mnaseseq** is a bioinformatics analysis pipeline used for DNA sequencing data obtained via micrococcal nuclease digestion.

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

### Pipeline summary

1. Raw read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
2. Adapter trimming ([`Trim Galore!`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/))
3. Alignment ([`BWA`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files/))
4. Mark duplicates ([`picard`](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/))
5. Merge alignments from multiple libraries of the same sample ([`picard`](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/))
    1. Re-mark duplicates ([`picard`](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/))
    2. Filtering to remove:
        * reads mapping to blacklisted regions ([`SAMtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/), [`BEDTools`](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/))
        * reads that are marked as duplicates ([`SAMtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/))
        * reads that arent marked as primary alignments ([`SAMtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/))
        * reads that are unmapped ([`SAMtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/))
        * reads that map to multiple locations ([`SAMtools`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/))
        * reads containing > 4 mismatches ([`BAMTools`](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools))
        * reads that are soft-clipped ([`BAMTools`](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools))
        * reads that have an insert size within specified range ([`BAMTools`](https://github.com/pezmaster31/bamtools); *paired-end only*)
        * reads that map to different chromosomes ([`Pysam`](http://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html); *paired-end only*)
        * reads that arent in FR orientation ([`Pysam`](http://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html); *paired-end only*)
        * reads where only one read of the pair fails the above criteria ([`Pysam`](http://pysam.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html); *paired-end only*)
    3. Alignment-level QC and estimation of library complexity ([`picard`](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), [`Preseq`](http://smithlabresearch.org/software/preseq/))
    4. Create normalised bigWig files scaled to 1 million mapped reads ([`BEDTools`](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2/), [`bedGraphToBigWig`](http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/admin/exe/))
    5. Calculate genome-wide coverage assessment ([`deepTools`](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotFingerprint.html))
    6. Call nucleosome positions and generate smoothed, normalised coverage bigWig files that can be used to generate occupancy profile plots between samples across features of interest ([`DANPOS2`](https://sites.google.com/site/danposdoc/))
    7. Generate gene-body meta-profile from DANPOS2 smoothed bigWig files ([`deepTools`](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotProfile.html))
6. Create IGV session file containing bigWig tracks for data visualisation ([`IGV`](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/)).
7. Present QC for raw read and alignment results ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))

## Quick Start

i. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

ii. Install one of [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) or [`conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)

iii. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/mnaseseq -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda>
```

iv. Start running your own analysis!

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/mnaseseq -profile <docker/singularity/conda> --design design.csv --genome GRCh37
```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.
